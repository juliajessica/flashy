            <p class="hide-text">Assignment Operator: This refers to the "=" (equals) sign and assigns a variable. A variable is the framework of the information.</p>

            <h3>Variables</h3>
            <p class="hide-text">Are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This data can then be used throughout your program.</p>

            <h3>Variable naming conventions</h3>
            <p class="hide-text">A naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.</p>

            <h3>Functions</h3>
            <p class="hide-text">A function is a type of procedure or routine. Some programming languages make a distinction between a function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some operation but does not return a value.</p>

            <h3>Methods</h3>
            <p class="hide-text">Is a procedure associated with a message and an object. An object is mostly made up of data and behavior, which form the interface that an object presents to the outside world. Data is represented as properties of the object and behavior as methods.</p>

            <h3>Return</h3>
            <p class="hide-text">A return statement causes execution to leave the current subroutine and resume at the point in the code immediately after where the subroutine was called, known as its return address.</p>

            <h3>Chaining methods</h3>
            <p class="hide-text">A common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object-oriented programming languages. Each method returns an object, allowing the calls to be chained together in a single statement without requiring variables to store the intermediate results.</p>

            <h3>Strings</h3>
            <p class="hide-text">A string is any finite sequence of characters (i.e., letters, numerals, symbols and punctuation marks). An important characteristic of each string is its length, which is the number of characters in it. The length can be any natural number (i.e., zero or any positive integer).</p>

            <h3>Booleans</h3>
            <p class="hide-text">The Boolean data type is a data type, having two values (usually denoted true and false), intended to represent the truth values of logic and Boolean algebra. It is named after George Boole, who first defined an algebraic system of logic in the mid 19th century.</p>

            <h3>Undefined</h3>
            <p class="hide-text">A condition where an expression does not have a correct value, although it is syntactically correct. ... Dynamically typed languages usually treat undefined values explicitly when possible</p>

            <h3>NaN</h3>
            <p class="hide-text">In computing, NaN, standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations.</p>

            <h3>Escape</h3>
            <p class="hide-text">A character which invokes an alternative interpretation on subsequent characters in a character sequence. An escape character is a particular case of metacharacters. Generally, the judgment of whether something is an escape character or not depends on context.</p>

            <h3>Comments</h3>
            <p class="hide-text">In computer programming, a comment is a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a computer program. They are added with the purpose of making the source code easier for humans to understand, and are generally ignored by compilers and interpreters.</p>

            <p class="hide-text">In computing, an attribute is a specification that defines a property of an object, element, or file. It may also refer to or set the specific value for a given instance of such. For clarity, attributes should more correctly be considered metadata.</p>
